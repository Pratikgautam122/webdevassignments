        </ol>

        <p>I enjoy spending time coding and building new projects. Each project teaches me something valuable and helps me grow as a developer. I also love collaborating with others and learning from their experiences.</p>

        <p>Beyond coding, I make sure to stay active by playing football and reading books. These hobbies help me maintain a balanced lifestyle and keep my mind fresh for problem solving and creative thinking.</p>

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">My Favorite Foods</h3>

        <p>Web development is an exciting field that combines creativity with technical skills. Learning HTML and CSS is the first step towards building amazing websites.</p>

        <p>As I continue my journey in web development, I discover new techniques and best practices every day. The possibilities are endless when it comes to creating interactive and beautiful web experiences.</p>

        <p>I am particularly interested in responsive design and making websites that work well on all devices. This ensures that users have a great experience whether they are on a phone, tablet, or computer.</p>

        <p>In the future, I plan to learn JavaScript, React, and other modern web technologies. These tools will help me create dynamic and powerful web applications that can solve real world problems.</p>
